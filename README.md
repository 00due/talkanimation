# Troubleshooting

 Please submit your issue into [Github issues](https://github.com/00due/talkanimation/issues).

# Using the plugin:
 You have to have currentcharactername[talk].png in img/characters folder.

 The animated talking frames are the walking frames.

 Make sure you aren't using direction fix on the event or the player, or else the talking animation won't play.

 Use `\atalk[actorId]` or `\etalk[eventId]` in the message box to start the animation.

 In atalk, actor ID 0 means the player. The rest means the party members in order.

 In etalk, event ID 0 means the event that is currently running.

 Compability with VisuMZ_2_MessageLog:

 - Use VisuMZ_1_MessageCore to replace \atalk and \etalk with nothing.
